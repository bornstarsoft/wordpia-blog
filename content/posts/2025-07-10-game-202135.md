In a pivotal moment for the gaming community, Rare is set to unveil the future of Sea of Thieves during its first-ever community direct, scheduled for tomorrow. This event comes on the heels of significant layoffs at Microsoft, which have raised concerns about the stability and direction of its gaming studios, including Rare. The community direct promises insights into upcoming seasons and major changes, providing a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.
