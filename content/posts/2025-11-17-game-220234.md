As 2025 draws to a close, Metacritic has unveiled its list of the worst games of the year, with Build a Rocket Boy's MindsEye taking the dubious honor of the worst-reviewed title. With a dismal Metascore of just 37, this single-player action game faced significant technical issues at launch, leading to PlayStation offering refundsa rare move reminiscent of the Cyberpunk 2077 debacle.

Following MindsEye, Bandai Namco's Tamagotchi Plaza and Nintendo's Switch 2 Welcome Tour also made the list, criticized for their simplistic gameplay and lack of engaging content. This year's bottom ten highlights a troubling trend in gaming, where expectations often clash with reality. As we reflect on these missteps, one has to wonder: what can developers learn from these failures to improve future releases?
