Karnataka is on the brink of a significant transformation, with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announcing that the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics (AVGC) and eXtended Reality (XR) sector could create 20 lakh jobs in the state. This ambitious projection comes alongside a potential revenue generation of $10 billion, highlighting the immense opportunities within this burgeoning industry.

During the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2021, Siddaramaiah emphasized the state government's commitment to fostering the AVGC-XR sector by providing essential infrastructure and incentives to attract investments. He also pointed out the critical need for upskilling and reskilling the workforce to align with the evolving demands of this fast-paced industry.

As the tech landscape continues to evolve, Karnataka's proactive approach could serve as a model for other regions looking to harness the potential of the AVGC-XR sector. Will this initiative pave the way for a new era of job creation and innovation in the tech industry?
