A new video game based on the iconic Friday the 13th franchise is officially in development, as revealed during a recent San Diego Comic-Con panel. Robert Barsamian, executive vice president at Horror Inc, confirmed that both a sequel game and a new movie are high on their priority list. This announcement comes after a long hiatus for the franchise, which has not seen a new film since the 2009 reboot.

While details about the upcoming game remain scarce, Barsamian did not clarify if it would be a direct follow-up to 2017's Friday the 13th: The Game. The previous title, which was pulled from sale at the end of 2023 due to licensing issues, had garnered a dedicated fanbase, making the anticipation for a sequel even more palpable. With Jason Universe now at the helm, fans can expect fresh content that aims to modernize the beloved horror series.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the developers balance nostalgia with innovation in this new installment. Will it capture the essence of what made the original game a hit while introducing new mechanics? Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling project!
