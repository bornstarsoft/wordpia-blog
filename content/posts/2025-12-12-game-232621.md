Capcom has officially announced the development of a new Mega Man game titled *Mega Man: Dual Override*, set to release in 2027 across multiple platforms including PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. This exciting news comes as part of Capcom's strategy to elevate franchises like Mega Man to the status of their core IPs, which currently include Resident Evil and Street Fighter.

The brief trailer revealed at The Game Awards showcases the classic 2D gameplay that fans love, now enhanced with a vibrant cel-shaded art style. Players will once again take on the role of Mega Man, navigating through futuristic landscapes and battling hordes of robots. This revival of a beloved franchise not only aims to attract long-time fans but also to bring in new players, aligning with Capcom's ambitious goal of selling 100 million games annually.

As Capcom continues to expand its portfolio, the anticipation for *Mega Man: Dual Override* raises questions about how this new entry will innovate while staying true to its roots. Will it capture the hearts of a new generation while satisfying the nostalgia of veteran players? Only time will tell.
