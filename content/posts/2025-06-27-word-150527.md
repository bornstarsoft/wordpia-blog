Capcom has taken a bold step into uncharted territory with its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. The recently unveiled gameplay reveals players engaging in a dynamic mini-game where they hack robots while simultaneously dodging their attacks. This innovative approach not only adds layers of strategy to combat but also sets Pragmata apart in the crowded gaming landscape.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, players will navigate the challenges alongside Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, and his android companion, Diana. The game's intriguing narrative and character dynamics promise to enrich the overall experience, making it more than just a typical shooter. With its initial announcement dating back to June 2020 and multiple delays pushing its release to 2026, anticipation is building for what could be one of Capcom's most original IPs to date.

As we look forward to more gameplay reveals and insights, one can't help but wonder: will Pragmata redefine the puzzle-shooter genre and set new standards for future games? Only time will tell, but with Capcom's track record, the potential is certainly there.
