November 2025 marked a significant downturn in the gaming industry, as hardware sales and physical game spending in the US reached their lowest levels in 30 years. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is particularly alarming given that November is typically a robust month for sales, driven by Black Friday and holiday shopping.

The average price for a new gaming console hit an all-time high of $439, up 11% from last year, which likely contributed to the drop in sales. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, spending on physical software also plummeted, falling 14% compared to the previous year, marking an all-time low for November since tracking began.

As we look ahead, the question remains: how will console manufacturers adapt to these challenges? With rising component costs and tariffs, the future of dedicated gaming devices hangs in the balance. Will we see a shift towards more affordable options, or will prices continue to climb, further alienating consumers?
