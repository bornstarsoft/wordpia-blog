In a bold move that has sent ripples through the gaming community, Hideaki Itsuno, the legendary director behind iconic titles like Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma, has established a new studio in Osaka. This venture not only marks Itsuno's departure from Capcom after over three decades but also signals a fresh start for the creation of original AAA IPs, a rarity in the current gaming landscape. With a team composed largely of Capcom veterans, including narrative designer Toshihiro Nakagawa and artist Daigo Ikeno, the new studio is poised to leverage their collective experience to craft something truly special.

Itsuno's vision is clear: he aims to create original content rather than relying solely on sequels. This ambition reflects a growing trend among developers who seek to innovate in an industry often dominated by franchises. The hiring of notable figures like 'Bengus', a veteran illustrator known for his work on Street Fighter, adds to the excitement surrounding this new project. As the studio ramps up production on its unannounced title, the gaming world is keenly watching to see how this team of industry legends will redefine action gaming.

With the gaming industry evolving rapidly, the question remains: will Itsuno's new studio succeed in creating a groundbreaking title that resonates with both fans and newcomers alike? The anticipation is palpable as we await further developments from this promising new venture.
