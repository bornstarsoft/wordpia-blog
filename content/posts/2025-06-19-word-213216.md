NINES has officially announced their upcoming puzzle game, **Pipeworks Puzzle**, which promises to bring a unique twist to the beloved tile sliding genre. Set in a vibrant construction site, players will step into the shoes of a plumber tasked with arranging disordered pipes to match a specific blueprint. With charming visuals and soothing soundtracks, this game is designed to provide a relaxing yet engaging experience.

One of the standout features of Pipeworks Puzzle is its grid-based arena where players can only move pipes in cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right. This design choice not only enhances the challenge but also encourages strategic thinking. Additionally, players will be guided by a support character named ‘Boss,’ created by Twitch artist PokuriMio, who will help novices evolve into master plumbers throughout their journey.

Excitingly, Pipeworks Puzzle is already available for wishlisting on Steam, with the potential to unlock new game features like an endless mode and speedrun challenges as more players express interest. A demo is also on the horizon, so be sure to follow the game on Steam to stay updated. With its innovative gameplay and adorable aesthetics, Pipeworks Puzzle is shaping up to be a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts when it launches later this year.
