In a recent discussion, Helldivers 2 developer Brendan Armstrong revealed a surprising fact: the PC version of the game requires approximately three times more storage than its console counterparts. This discrepancy, with a hefty 150GB install size on PC compared to the significantly smaller sizes on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, stems from the need to accommodate players still using mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs).

Armstrong explained that while modern consoles utilize solid state drives (SSDs) that provide rapid access to data, many PC gamers still rely on slower HDDs. To mitigate the performance bottleneck caused by HDDs, the development team duplicates certain data files, ensuring they are stored close together on the disk. This approach allows for faster loading times, but it also inflates the overall storage requirements for the PC version.

As the gaming community continues to evolve, the challenge remains: how to balance installation sizes with loading speeds for all players. Armstrong's insights highlight the complexities developers face in catering to diverse hardware setups. Will we see a shift towards more optimized solutions in future game releases? Only time will tell.
