The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as a potential leak regarding the release date of Bungie's highly anticipated extraction shooter, Marathon, has surfaced. A Reddit user claimed to have spotted a pre-order trailer on the Xbox store, revealing a release date of March 5, 2026. This date, if accurate, marks a significant update from Bungie's previous announcement of a March release window without a specific date.

Originally slated for a September 2025 release, Marathon faced delays due to mixed feedback from alpha tests and controversy over artwork issues. Now, with a new release date on the horizon, fans are eager to see how Bungie has refined the game based on community feedback. The game is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, priced at $39.99, and promises no pay-to-win mechanics.

As we await official confirmation from Bungie, the excitement around Marathon continues to grow. Will this leak hold true, or will we see further changes before the game's release? Only time will tell.
