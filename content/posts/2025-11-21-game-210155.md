In a stunning turn of events, Ghost of Yotei has clinched the prestigious Console Game of the Year award at the Golden Joystick Awards, solidifying its place in gaming history. This action-adventure title not only won the coveted title but also took home the award for Best Audio Design, showcasing the exceptional craftsmanship behind its immersive experience.

Despite facing skepticism and calls for a boycott prior to its release, Ghost of Yotei has proven its critics wrong, selling over 3.3 million copies since launch and becoming one of the top-selling games in the US this year. The game's success is a testament to its quality and the dedication of its developers at Sucker Punch, who have created a masterpiece that resonates with players worldwide.
