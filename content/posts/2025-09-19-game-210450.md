Disordered Media is set to launch their first-person horror puzzle game, oneway.exe, on October 7 for PC and Mac via Steam. This game offers a unique experience where players explore a haunting virtual environment that simulates a full operating system, allowing them to interact with applications and files as if they were on a real computer. The first "Module" will be available at launch, with subsequent chapters to follow, promising an evolving narrative that dives deeper into its eerie world.

In oneway.exe, players will encounter an ensemble cast of eight memorable characters, each inspired by chilling internet stories. As you navigate the unsettling halls of UNTITLED.EXE, you will uncover digital horrors that blur the lines between reality and the virtual realm. The games atmosphere is enriched by an original soundtrack composed by Marcy Nabors, known for their work on DELTARUNE, enhancing the immersive experience as players delve into the dark narrative.

With its innovative approach to storytelling and gameplay, oneway.exe invites players to explore multiple paths and face the haunting characters lurking within its digital confines. As we await its launch, one can't help but wonder: what other digital horrors lie in wait for those brave enough to enter?
