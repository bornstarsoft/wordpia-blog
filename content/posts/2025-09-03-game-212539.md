Nintendo has just announced that Forsaken 64 will be the 40th Nintendo 64 game added to its Switch Online library, specifically in the Mature-rated app. This addition is significant not only for fans of retro gaming but also for those who appreciate the unique gameplay mechanics of first-person shooters from the late '90s. Forsaken 64, originally published by Acclaim in 1998, offers a distinct experience with its zero-gravity ship controls, challenging players to navigate through intricate levels while battling robotic foes.

The game is joining a select group of titles in the Mature 17+ app, which includes classics like Perfect Dark and Turok. Forsaken 64's unusual box art, featuring a tearful woman, adds to its cult status among gamers. As we look forward to this nostalgic addition, it raises the question: how will modern players adapt to the unconventional controls and gameplay style of this classic title?
