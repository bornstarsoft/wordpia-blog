After two decades in the shadows, the Metal Slug development team's long-lost project, *Navinosuke: The Yo-Kai Buster*, is set to make its debut on the Nintendo Switch in 2026. Originally conceived for the Game Boy Advance, this pixel RPG was shelved before it could ever be revealed to the public. Now, thanks to the efforts of Kohachi Studio, fans will finally get to experience this unique title that blends traditional Japanese folklore with RPG mechanics.

*Navinosuke* is described as a "phantom RPG" featuring over 150 yokai, or Japanese monsters, as companions on a journey across the archipelago. The game's director, Shinano Ishiguro, has shared that the project was nearly abandoned multiple times, but the passion to bring it to life endured. Interestingly, the game was initially designed to utilize a GPS unit for real-world exploration, a concept that predates the popular *PokÃ©mon GO* by many years. This innovative approach could have changed the landscape of mobile gaming had it not been for the challenges faced during development.

As we look forward to the release of *Navinosuke* next year, it's fascinating to consider how this game could have influenced the gaming industry had it launched as originally intended. Will this revival spark renewed interest in retro-style RPGs, or will it serve as a nostalgic reminder of what could have been? Only time will tell.
