In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will officially go offline on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking a significant shift in Amazon's approach to MMO development. Players will have one last year to enjoy the game before it becomes permanently inaccessible.

The decision to end service on New World follows an earlier announcement that no additional content would be released after the Nighthaven seasonal update. Players who have purchased the game will still be able to download it, but they will no longer have the ability to play it once the servers are shut down. This closure not only affects the game itself but also signals a broader change in Amazon's gaming strategy.

As we reflect on the journey of New World: Aeternum, its clear that the community played a vital role in shaping its world. Amazon Games expressed gratitude towards its players for their dedication and passion. With just a year left, how will the community come together to celebrate the legacy of Aeternum before its final farewell?
