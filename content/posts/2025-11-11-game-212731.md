In a surprising turn of events, the promising retro-futuristic adventure game, The Midnight Riders, has been canceled by NetEase, leaving fans and developers alike in shock. This decision comes as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy by the publisher, which has seen significant layoffs and studio closures this year. Despite the cancellation, Bad Brain Game Studios head Sean Crooks has shared a five-minute sizzle reel, hoping to attract potential investors and breathe new life into the project.

Set in the nostalgic 1980s, The Midnight Riders follows a teenager named Josh as he navigates a world filled with mystery and danger, reminiscent of beloved series like Stranger Things. The game promised an engaging narrative intertwined with shared nightmares and quirky gameplay mechanics, such as using a slingshot and a gasoline-filled water gun to fend off nightmarish creatures. With the studio's closure looming, there remains a glimmer of hope as both Bad Brain and NetEase are open to selling the game's intellectual property.

As we reflect on the potential of The Midnight Riders, one can't help but wonder: will this unique concept find a new home, or is it destined to remain a lost gem in the annals of gaming history? The gaming community eagerly awaits any news that might revive this intriguing project.
