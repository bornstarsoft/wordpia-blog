In a surprising turn of events, Mario Kart World has reclaimed its position at the top of the UK physical game sales charts, showcasing the enduring popularity of this beloved franchise. After a brief stint at number two, the Nintendo racer has knocked Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater down to third place, reaffirming its status as a fan favorite since its release in June.

This week also saw the introduction of new titles like Cronos: The New Dawn, which made a strong debut at number four. However, not all newcomers fared well; NBA 2K26 and Everybodys Golf Hot Shots struggled to break into the top ten, landing at 14th and 15th respectively. This highlights the competitive nature of the gaming market, where even established franchises can face challenges from new entrants.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve, especially with the increasing shift towards digital sales. Will Mario Kart World maintain its lead, or will new titles shake up the charts in the coming weeks?
