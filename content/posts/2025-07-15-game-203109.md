In a surprising turn of events, the strategy game John Wick Hex is set to be removed from sale just under six years after its initial release. Developed by Bithell Games and published by Big Fan Games, the game will no longer be available for purchase starting July 17, 2025. While existing owners can still access the game, new players will miss out on this unique title that combines strategy with the beloved John Wick universe.

The delisting raises questions about the future of licensed games, especially when it comes to negotiations between publishers and rights holders. Although no specific reason was provided for this decision, its speculated that Big Fan Games may have faced challenges in renewing their licensing agreement with Lionsgate Games, the owner of the John Wick franchise. This situation serves as a reminder for gamers to be vigilant about digital game availability, as titles can vanish from storefronts without much warning.

John Wick Hex is more than just a game; it features an original storyline and voice acting from iconic actors like Ian McShane and Lance Reddick. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, its essential for fans to seize opportunities to experience unique titles before they disappear. Will you be adding John Wick Hex to your library before its too late?
