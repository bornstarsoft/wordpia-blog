Japan's National Diet Library (NDL) has made a significant decision regarding the preservation of video games, stating that Switch 2 Game-Key Cards will not be included in its collection. This decision highlights a crucial distinction in the digital age: what constitutes physical media and how we preserve our digital culture.

Established in 1948, the NDL requires all domestic publishers to submit copies of new publications for preservation. While it has successfully archived over 9,600 video games since 2000, the NDL has determined that Game-Key Cards, which serve merely as download keys rather than containing game data themselves, do not meet their criteria for preservation. This raises important questions about the future of digital content and how institutions will adapt to the evolving landscape of media.

As we move further into a digital-first world, the implications of this decision extend beyond Japan. How will other libraries and institutions approach the preservation of digital content? Will we see a shift in how we define and protect our cultural artifacts? The conversation is just beginning, and its one that will shape the future of media preservation for generations to come.
