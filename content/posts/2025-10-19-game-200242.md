After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is set to finally release in Q4 of 2025, marking a significant moment in retro gaming history. Originally developed between 1999 and 2001, this tactical RPG faced cancellation in 2002 but has since been revived thanks to the efforts of Incube8 Games, who acquired the rights and launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to bring it back to life.

Infinity promises to deliver an immersive experience with its unique strategic battle system, a rich narrative involving rival nations and ancient evils, and stunning 8-bit graphics. Players can explore over 30 areas and interact with more than 100 items, making it a must-have for fans of the genre. With pre-orders now available for various editions, including collectors items, the excitement surrounding this release is palpable.

As we look forward to its launch, one can't help but wonder: will Infinity set a new standard for retro RPGs, or will it simply be a nostalgic trip down memory lane? Only time will tell!
