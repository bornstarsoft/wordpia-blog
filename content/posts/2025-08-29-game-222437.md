Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is gearing up for its highly anticipated annual Summit, set to take place on September 24, 2025, just ahead of the Tokyo Game Show. This event is not just a routine announcement; it holds the promise of unveiling the next chapter in the beloved Like A Dragon series, alongside potential insights into the mysterious Stranger Than Heaven, previously known as Project Century.

Last year's Summit brought us the thrilling announcement of Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza, which fans eagerly embraced.

While details about Stranger Than Heaven remain scarce, the historical setting of Japan in 1915 hints at a unique narrative that could captivate players.

As Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio continues to innovate, the gaming community is left wondering: what groundbreaking announcements will emerge from this year's Summit? Stay tuned for what promises to be an exhilarating event for fans and gamers alike.
