Indie developer Pixel Maniacs is making waves with their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, boldly claiming to fill the void left by Valve's absence in the Portal franchise. With a cheeky nod to the gaming community, they assert, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement sets the stage for a game that aims to capture the essence of beloved puzzle mechanics while introducing its own unique twist.

At first glance, ChromaGun 2 shares a vibrant aesthetic reminiscent of Portal, but the gameplay diverges significantly. Players will wield a colorful gun to manipulate objects, echoing the mechanics of Qube rather than the iconic portals of its predecessor. The game places you in a testing environment, albeit one that feels more voluntary than the often ominous Aperture Science chambers. With a free demo available on Steam, gamers can dive into this colorful world and see if it lives up to the high bar set by its inspirations.

The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, garnered 'Mostly Positive' reviews, suggesting that Pixel Maniacs has a solid foundation to build upon. As we look forward to the release of ChromaGun 2, it raises an intriguing question: can indie developers successfully carry the torch of beloved franchises, or will they forge a new path entirely?
