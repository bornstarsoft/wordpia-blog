In a recent financial call, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa addressed concerns regarding the rising costs of memory and its potential impact on the pricing of the Switch 2. While he reassured shareholders that there are currently no plans to increase the console's price, he acknowledged that if memory prices continue to surge, the company would need to re-evaluate its pricing strategy in the future.

Furukawa emphasized that Nintendo is actively engaging with suppliers to secure a stable supply of components, which has helped mitigate the impact of rising memory costs on hardware profitability. He noted that the company's decisions regarding price adjustments would consider various factors, including market conditions and sales trends, rather than reacting solely to short-term fluctuations in component costs.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo navigates these challenges. Will they maintain the current pricing strategy, or will external pressures force them to adapt? The coming months will be crucial for the Switch 2's success and Nintendo's overall strategy in the gaming market.
