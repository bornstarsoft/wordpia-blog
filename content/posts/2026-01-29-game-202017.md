Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, for free on Steam. This game stands out with its unique premise of creating a "fake clear video" for a failed dungeon raid, all wrapped in a nostalgic Windows 98 aesthetic. Players will step into the shoes of a video editor, tasked with stitching together clips from poorly executed raids to craft the illusion of a flawless victory.

At the heart of the gameplay lies an 8-tick timeline that demands precision and strategy. Players will need to analyze enemy attack patterns and arrange various action clips to create a seamless narrative of triumph. The game cleverly juxtaposes the chaotic reality of the dungeon raids with the polished facade presented to the world, offering a satirical take on heroism and storytelling in gaming.

As we anticipate the release, it's exciting to see how this blend of strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation will resonate with players. Will you be ready to create your own "perfect" victory?
