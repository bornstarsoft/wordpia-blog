Xbox Insiders are getting an exciting sneak peek at a new aggregated gaming library feature that promises to streamline the gaming experience on Windows 11 PCs. This innovative update aims to consolidate all your installed games from various storefronts into one convenient location within the Xbox PC app. With the gaming landscape often cluttered by multiple platforms, this feature could significantly enhance accessibility for gamers.

The new library setup allows players to easily load their games regardless of where they were purchased, whether from Microsoft, Battle.net, or Xbox Game Pass. This means no more fumbling around to remember which storefront has your favorite title installed. For those who prefer a more tailored experience, Microsoft has included an option to hide specific storefronts within the library settings, ensuring that users can customize their view to their liking.

Currently, this feature is in the testing phase for Xbox Insiders, with plans for a broader rollout anticipated during the upcoming holiday season. As the gaming community eagerly awaits the launch of the Xbox Ally handhelds, itâ€™s clear that Microsoft is committed to enhancing the PC gaming experience. Will this new library feature change the way we manage our game collections? Only time will tell.
