Rare has officially announced that paid custom servers will be introduced to Sea of Thieves in early 2026. This exciting development was revealed during the games first community direct, Custom Seas. Players will have the opportunity to create their own private servers, complete with exclusive tools like the cinematic camera used for game trailers. While specific pricing details are yet to be disclosed, Rare has indicated that supporting this feature will come with a monthly fee due to its complexity and resource demands.

In addition to the custom servers, Rare is also revamping the games seasonal model. With the momentum of recent seasons stalling, the upcoming Season 17 will feature a new structure where each three-month season is divided into three distinct phases. The first month will focus on reinvigorating the sandbox experience, the second will spotlight live events, and the third will emphasize community engagement. This strategic overhaul aims to enhance player experience and keep the game fresh and engaging.

As we look forward to these changes, the introduction of paid custom servers could significantly alter how players interact with Sea of Thieves. Will this new feature bring a resurgence of interest in the game, or will it create a divide within the community?
