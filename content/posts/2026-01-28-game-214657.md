Highguard, the newly launched free-to-play shooter, has made waves by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its first day. However, this impressive figure is overshadowed by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews on Steam, raising questions about the game's overall reception. With only 32.05% of reviews being positive, players have voiced concerns primarily about the game's expansive map size, which many feel is ill-suited for its 3vs3 matchups.

Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio comprised of industry veterans from franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's ambitious launch was highly anticipated, especially after its prominent reveal at The Game Awards. Despite the initial player enthusiasm, the disconnect between player expectations and the game's design choices has led to a mixed reception.

As Highguard continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the developers respond to player feedback and whether they can turn the tide of public opinion. Will future updates address the concerns raised by the community, or will Highguard remain a cautionary tale of high expectations meeting reality?
