In an exciting showcase of intellect and teamwork, academic teams from Triangle Math & Science Academy and Lee Early College recently faced off in the latest edition of Brain Game. This event, held on January 3, 2026, not only highlights the importance of academic competitions but also emphasizes the growing interest in STEM education among high school students.
