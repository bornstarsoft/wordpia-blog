According to the latest State of the Game Industry survey conducted by the Game Developers Conference (GDC), a striking trend has emerged: developers are showing a clear preference for creating games on the PS5 and Switch 2 over the Xbox Series X/S. With only 20% of surveyed developers expressing interest in Xbox, compared to 40% for PS5 and 39% for Switch 2, this shift indicates a significant change in the gaming landscape.

The survey, which included responses from over 2,300 industry professionals, highlights that while PC remains the top choice for game development at 80%, the enthusiasm for Xbox lags behind other platforms, even Android and iOS. This trend raises questions about Xbox's strategy as it continues to position itself as a multiplatform business, with major titles like Fable and Forza Horizon 6 set to release on PS5 alongside their Xbox counterparts.

As the gaming industry evolves, it will be interesting to see how these preferences shape future game releases and platform strategies. Will Xbox be able to regain developer interest, or will the trend towards PS5 and Switch 2 continue to dominate?
