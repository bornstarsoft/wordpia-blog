Netflix is making a significant move into the daily puzzle games market with the upcoming launch of Netflix Puzzled. This new app will feature a variety of puzzles inspired by some of Netflix's most popular franchises, including Stranger Things, Bridgerton, and Squid Game. With classics like sudoku and innovative twists on traditional games like crosswords, Netflix aims to engage its subscribers in a fun and interactive way.

The app is set to be available soon on both iOS and Android platforms, and it will also be the first Netflix game accessible through the Tudum website. Best of all, Netflix Puzzled will come at no extra cost for subscribers, making it an attractive addition to the streaming service's offerings. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Netflix's foray into puzzle games resonates with its audience and whether it can carve out a niche in this competitive market.

As we await the official release, one has to wonder: will Netflix Puzzled become a daily ritual for fans of these beloved shows, or will it struggle to compete with established puzzle games? Only time will tell.
