On December 19, Wordle players around the globe faced an unexpected challenge when the five-letter word of the day was "myrrh". This vowel-less word left many players frustrated, as their usual strategies of identifying vowels first were rendered ineffective. The New York Times described the puzzle as moderately challenging, but for many, it felt like a test of endurance rather than skill.

Players took to social media and forums to express their disbelief and frustration, with some even questioning the legitimacy of the word itself. Comments ranged from disbelief to appreciation for its seasonal relevance, as myrrh is historically tied to Christmas. This incident highlights how even seasoned gamers can be caught off guard by unexpected word choices, reminding us that language can be both a tool and a challenge.

As we continue to engage with games like Wordle, it raises the question: how do we adapt our strategies when faced with the unexpected? Perhaps the next puzzle will encourage us to think outside the boxor in this case, outside the vowels.
